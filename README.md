# Arduino Demos

Some practical demos while getting started with different Arduino sensors.

## Getting Started

Just clone the repo and upload any example to your arduino.

### Prerequisites

I am using an Arduino UNO R3 with the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and a bunch of different sensors (list will come soon).

### Examples
#### LCD, IR, Led example 
```
/examples/lcd__IR_sensor
```
Capture input from IR sensor and control LEDs while displaying IR codes on the LCD.
#### Color game - Uses an IR sensor, a remote, and a 3 colored LEDs
```
/examples/color_game
```
Use the remote to turn off the lights before it's too late.

## Built With
